# Galaxy Defender

This is a simple console game allowing you to move around the console window and shoot enemy ships.


## Game Info
#### Controls
Use your arrow keys to move your ship around the screen.

Use your number keys to shoot bullets out different directions. The direction of the bullet is the same as displayed on a number pad.

#### Pieces
- User\'s ship: <=>
- Enemy ship: <^>
- Bullet: *
- Star: +

#### Game Play
Shoot the enemy ships. Some target the user\'s ship and some are passive.
Running into another ship will cause you to lose the game.
The stars are in the distance so running over them will only hide them until the game object is no longer on it.
